Your constants here : Based on the KPI file being imported
WINDOW = Number of days to consider in the rolling average and standard deviation window to find if current day is a deviation
SIGMA_THRESHOLD = Any deviation above this threshold will be considered as a trend change
KEY = The fields in the file which are not the KPI but the device identifier. Like RNC Name, EnodeB Name, Cell Name etc. Case sensitive
TIMEINDEX = The field in the file which represents Time. Should be convertable into DateTime
DOI = Date of Interest. If you know that the changes would have happened around a specific date, then specify it as "YYYY-MM-DD", else keep this field as DOI = "" and the script will highlight all the trend changes it can see.Â¶
ISGOOGLE = If you are using this script on Google Colab then keep it True, else False. Only difference is in loading file where on Google, you will need to upload a file whereas on Local computer, you need to specify the filename as a variable called file1
